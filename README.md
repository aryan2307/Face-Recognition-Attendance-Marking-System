# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Marking-System
This is project made with python that can recognize a person and mark their attendance in a csv file.
This image shows the main screen of the app. On pressing the "start face recognition" button, a camera window will pop up and start face recognition. It also has text instructing the user to press the "q" key on his/her keyboard to stop recognition.

It will show a box around any faces it finds and display the name of the person if he/she gets recognised. If the person is not recognised, it will display "Image not found" next to the face.
